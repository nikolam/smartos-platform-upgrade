smartos-platform-upgrade
========================

A script to simplify upgrades of USB booted SmartOS installations.

Installation
------------

```
[root@acro ~]# curl -kL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org-tekeli-borisp/smartos-platform-upgrade/master/platform-upgrade > /opt/local/bin/platform-upgrade
[root@acro ~]# chmod 755 /opt/local/bin/platform-upgrade
```

Usage
-----

Run the script. It'll find the USB stick, download the latest platform
from Joyent, do the upgrade and report its status. The download and
update platform stages will probably take a few minutes each. Kernel and
boot archive checksums are verified to make sure the files can be read
correctly from the USB stick.

```
[root@acro ~]# platform-upgrade
Downloading latest platform (platform-20150306T202346Z.tgz)... OK
Verifying checksum... OK
Extracting latest platform... OK
Marking release version... OK
Checking current boot device... detected c0t0d0, mounted, OK
Updating platform on boot device... OK
Remounting boot device... OK
Verifying kernel checksum on boot device... OK
Verifying boot_archive checksum on boot device... OK
Activating new platform on /dev/dsk/c0t0d0p1... OK

Boot device upgraded. To do:

 1) Sanity check the contents of /tmp/tmp.I8aw9L/usb
 2) umount /dev/dsk/c0t0d0p1
 3) reboot
[root@acro ~]# 
```

Once the upgrade is done, verify that the contents of the USB stick looks sane,
unmount it and reboot to the new platform.

```
[root@acro ~]# ls -l /tmp/tmp.I8aw9L/usb
total 24
drwxrwxrwx   1 root     root        4096 Jan  3  2011 boot
drwxrwxrwx   1 root     root        4096 Mar 13 07:33 old
drwxrwxrwx   1 root     root        4096 Mar 13 07:29 platform
[root@acro ~]# ls -l /tmp/tmp.I8aw9L/usb/platform/
total 10
drwxrwxrwx   1 root     root        4096 Mar 13 07:29 i86pc
-rwxrwxrwx   1 root     root          17 Mar  6 23:36 root.password
-rwxrwxrwx   1 root     root          17 Mar 13 07:29 version
[root@acro ~]# umount /dev/dsk/c0t0d0p1
[root@acro ~]# reboot
```

By default, the first removable device found is assumed to be the boot USB
stick. If this is not the case, the correct device name can be given on the
command line:

```
[root@acro ~]# platform-upgrade /dev/dsk/c1t0d0p1
Downloading latest platform (platform-20150306T202346Z.tgz)...
```
